## Dependencies
This project requires python and the following python libraries.
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. seaborn
4. matplotlib
5. scikit-learn

It also requires a software that can open and execute a Jupyter Notebook.


## Installation
1. Clone the repo or download using the url: https://github.com/intelaashish/Machine_Learning_Algorithms_Collection.git
2. Download the corresponding necessary data from the web for each jupyter notebook file.
3. Navigate to the  directory that contains the corresponding notebook.
4. Run the following command:
    ```properties
        jupyter notebook
     

6. This will open a tab on a web browser.
7. Click on the notebook file corresponding to the machine learning method that you want to explore.
